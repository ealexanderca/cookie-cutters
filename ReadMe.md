# Gear Cookie Cutters
## Cookie Cutters
These are the cad files for me involute gear cookie cutters. When I used them with the recipe below, it gave me perfect cookies that mesh with each other and spin with low resistance. The STL files are suitable to print, but the diameter of the center hole has yet to be tuned, so I have no idea what the final diameter will be. If you want to modify the SolidWorks files, there is a design table for the model with and without the middle hole. Happy Baking, and may your gears always mesh.
